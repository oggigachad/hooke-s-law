This project is an interactive Spring-Mass System Simulation built using p5.js. It visually demonstrates Hooke’s Law, which governs the behavior of springs when subjected to forces. The simulation allows users to modify key parameters such as:

Gravity (g): Adjust the gravitational pull on the mass.
Mass (kg): Change the weight of the object attached to the spring.
Spring Constant (K): Control the stiffness or elasticity of the spring.
How It Works
A mass (Bobby) is attached to a fixed anchor using a spring.
The motion is governed by Hooke’s Law (F = -k * x) and Newton’s Second Law (F = m * a).
The simulation calculates forces dynamically and updates the position of the mass in real-time.
Users can interact by modifying input values, influencing the motion of the system.
Features
✅ Real-time Physics Simulation – Responsive spring-mass movement.
✅ Interactive Controls – Users can adjust gravity, mass, and stiffness.
✅ Smooth UI & Responsive Design – Styled using CSS for a modern look.
